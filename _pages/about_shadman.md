<b>Md. Shadman Sakib</b>

<b>Background:</b> I hold a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) and completed my MSc in Civil Engineering in 2022. My master's research focused on applying Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to analyze the impact of storm surges on estuarine bridge systems. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Virginia Tech, where my research focuses on leveraging physics-informed and data-driven models to explore the dynamics of extreme events in coastal environments. This includes investigating compound flooding, coastal erosion, sea level rise, cascading hazards, and the impacts of climate change.

<b>Research Interests:</b> Compound flooding, Deep Learning, Remote Sensing

<b>Hobbies:</b> Playing soccer, cricket, and badminton, as well as building custom computers.

<b>Fun Fact or Motto:</b> <i>"Stress doesnâ€™t come from hard work. It primarily comes from not taking action on things within your control."</i> - Jeff Bezos. Therefore, I like to work as hard as I can, then savor the time I have left in the day to enjoy life, stress free!
