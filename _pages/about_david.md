I am a civil engineer interested in coastal hydrological processes including compound flood dynamics, wetland change, sea level rise, land subsidence, tropical cyclone (hurricane) events, and digital twin systems in the context of climate change and anthropogenic impacts.

I work with hybrid modeling methods and frameworks to conduct local to large-scale assessments. Such methods integrate:

1) Physics-informed models including coastal, hydrodynamic, hydraulic, and hydrologic models.

2) Statistical methods for uncertainty quantification, data assimilation, and sensitivity analysis.

3) Machine learning for pattern recognition, data fusion, and prediction tasks including shallow and deep learning architectures.

4) Big data management including remote sensing (satellite) and drone observations.
