The CoRAL Lab integrates physics-informed and data-driven models to understand complex compound extreme dynamics in human and natural systems. We are interested in statistical analysis, hydrodynamic modeling, machine learning, remote sensing, and data collection using drones.

<b><u>Vision:</u></b>

The CoRAL Lab aims at enhancing the characterization, modeling, and prediction of compound extreme dynamics at different scales as well as their impacts on vulnerable communities to flooding.

We aim at providing actionable flood hazard maps, adaptation and planning strategies that integrate green infrastructure and risk-flood information through scenario-based simulations.
